- **Method**: Basic Authentication (email:apikey in Base64)
- **Test Endpoint**: GET /ping
- **Security**: Password field, encrypted storage by n8n

### Node Implementation
- **File**: `nodes/Draiven/Draiven.node.ts`
- **Framework**: n8n-workflow (TypeScript)
- **API Calls**:
  - `GET /datasets` - Load datasets for dropdown
  - `GET /personas` - Load personas for dropdown
  - `POST /conversations` - Execute AI question

### Features Implemented
1. ✅ Operation selector (extensible for future features)
2. ✅ Multi-dataset selection
3. ✅ Persona selection
4. ✅ Question input (multi-line)
5. ✅ Conversation continuity (optional conversation ID)
6. ✅ Stream response option
7. ✅ Structured JSON output
8. ✅ Error handling with continue-on-fail
9. ✅ Custom branding (icon, colors)

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### Option 1: Local Testing
```bash
cd /home/dhiogo/Projects/draiven/draiven-n8n-node
npm install
npm run build
npm link
# Then in your n8n folder:
npm link n8n-nodes-draiven
# Restart n8n
```

### Option 2: Publish to npm
```bash
cd /home/dhiogo/Projects/draiven/draiven-n8n-node
npm install
npm run build
npm run lint
npm login
npm publish
```

### Option 3: Install from npm (after publishing)
In n8n:
1. Settings → Community Nodes
2. Install `n8n-nodes-draiven`
3. Restart n8n

## 📊 Usage Example

```javascript
// In n8n workflow:
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "draiven",
      "credentials": "draivenApi",
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "askQuestion",
        "datasets": [1, 2, 3],
        "persona": 5,
        "question": "What are the top products by revenue?",
        "additionalOptions": {
          "conversationId": "conv_123"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

// Output:
{
  "success": true,
  "conversationId": "conv_123",
  "question": "What are the top products by revenue?",
  "answer": "Based on your data, the top 5 products are...",
  "datasets": [1, 2, 3],
  "personaId": 5,
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2026-01-29T10:00:00Z",
    "model": "gpt-4"
  }
}
```
